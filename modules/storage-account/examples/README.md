# Azure Storage Account Terraform Module

Terraform Module to create an Azure storage account with a set of containers (and access level), set of file shares (and quota), tables, queues, Network policies and Blob lifecycle management.

## Module Usage

### Storage account with Containers

```hcl
# Azure Provider configuration
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

module "storage" {
  source  = "kumarvna/storage/azurerm"
  version = "2.4.0"

  # By default, this module will not create a resource group
  # proivde a name to use an existing resource group, specify the existing resource group name,
  # and set the argument to `create_resource_group = false`. Location will be same as existing RG.
  resource_group_name  = "rg-demo-internal-shared-westeurope-002"
  location             = "westeurope"
  storage_account_name = "mydefaultstorage"

  # To enable advanced threat protection set argument to `true`
  enable_advanced_threat_protection = true

  # Container lists with access_type to create
  containers_list = [
    { name = "mystore250", access_type = "private" },
    { name = "blobstore251", access_type = "blob" },
    { name = "containter252", access_type = "container" }
  ]
  # Adding TAG's to your Azure resources (Required)
  # ProjectName and Env are already declared above, to use them here, create a varible.
  tags = {
    ProjectName  = "demo-internal"
    Env          = "dev"
    Owner        = "user@example.com"
    BusinessUnit = "CORP"
    ServiceClass = "Gold"
  }
}
```

### Storage account with SMB File Shares

```hcl
# Azure Provider configuration
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

module "storage" {
  source  = "kumarvna/storage/azurerm"
  version = "2.4.0"

  # By default, this module will not create a resource group
  # proivde a name to use an existing resource group, specify the existing resource group name,
  # and set the argument to `create_resource_group = false`. Location will be same as existing RG.
  resource_group_name  = "rg-demo-internal-shared-westeurope-002"
  location             = "westeurope"
  storage_account_name = "mydefaultstorage"

  # To enable advanced threat protection set argument to `true`
  enable_advanced_threat_protection = true

  # SMB file share with quota (GB) to create
  file_shares = [
    { name = "smbfileshare1", quota = 50 },
    { name = "smbfileshare2", quota = 50 }
  ]

  # Adding TAG's to your Azure resources (Required)
  # ProjectName and Env are already declared above, to use them here, create a varible.
  tags = {
    ProjectName  = "demo-internal"
    Env          = "dev"
    Owner        = "user@example.com"
    BusinessUnit = "CORP"
    ServiceClass = "Gold"
  }
}
```

### Storage Account with all additional features

```hcl
# Azure Provider configuration
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

module "storage" {
  source  = "kumarvna/storage/azurerm"
  version = "2.4.0"

  # By default, this module will not create a resource group
  # proivde a name to use an existing resource group, specify the existing resource group name,
  # and set the argument to `create_resource_group = false`. Location will be same as existing RG.
  resource_group_name  = "rg-demo-internal-shared-westeurope-002"
  location             = "westeurope"
  storage_account_name = "mydefaultstorage"

  # To enable advanced threat protection set argument to `true`
  enable_advanced_threat_protection = true

  # Container lists with access_type to create
  containers_list = [
    { name = "mystore250", access_type = "private" },
    { name = "blobstore251", access_type = "blob" },
    { name = "containter252", access_type = "container" }
  ]

  # SMB file share with quota (GB) to create
  file_shares = [
    { name = "smbfileshare1", quota = 50 },
    { name = "smbfileshare2", quota = 50 }
  ]

  # Storage tables
  tables = ["table1", "table2", "table3"]

  # Storage queues
  queues = ["queue1", "queue2"]

  # Lifecycle management for storage account.
  # Must specify the value to each argument and default is `0`
  lifecycles = [
    {
      prefix_match               = ["mystore250/folder_path"]
      tier_to_cool_after_days    = 0
      tier_to_archive_after_days = 50
      delete_after_days          = 100
      snapshot_delete_after_days = 30
    },
    {
      prefix_match               = ["blobstore251/another_path"]
      tier_to_cool_after_days    = 0
      tier_to_archive_after_days = 30
      delete_after_days          = 75
      snapshot_delete_after_days = 30
    }
  ]

  # Adding TAG's to your Azure resources (Required)
  # ProjectName and Env are already declared above, to use them here, create a varible.
  tags = {
    ProjectName  = "demo-internal"
    Env          = "dev"
    Owner        = "user@example.com"
    BusinessUnit = "CORP"
    ServiceClass = "Gold"
  }
}
```
